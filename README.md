## Project Overview

The Bicycle Store API is a RESTful application developed using **Express.js** and **TypeScript**, integrating **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** to manage a Bicycle Store. This application allows CRUD operations for bicycles and orders and features robust inventory management.

## Key Features

1. **Product Management:**

   - Create, read, update, and delete bicycles.
   - Search bicycles by name, brand, or type.

2. **Order Management:**

   - Place orders, reduce inventory automatically, and update stock availability.
   - Error handling for insufficient stock.

3. **Revenue Calculation:**

   - Aggregates and calculates total revenue from all orders.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Descriptive error responses for validation, resource not found, and server issues.
